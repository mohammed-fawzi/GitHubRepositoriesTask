“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.
But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

—Steve Jobs

*the most important things i choose to focus on are:
    1- UI/UX because the design and user experience are the most important things especially from an iOS user perspective
    2- clean and readable code
    3- best practices
    4- try as much as possible to make the architecture simpler and bugs-immune
    5- algorithmic thinking to obtain the best performance
